# Bad Wolf Mini Turbo Map

Welcome to the public record of the Bad Wolf Turbo Maps! This repository was created to track all changes done to my turbo map. This repo includes two base maps. One for the **Haltech 750 Elite** which is a compelete fuel injected map. And one for the **DTA Fast ECU** which is an ignition only map. Both are public and can be used to help you get a spring board to start your mapping on your own car.

Before using you must understand these are **NOT PLUG AND PLAY**. Both maps will require you to bring your car and have it properly configured on a dyno to get the best and safest results. After reading the below disclaimer the download links are located in each section below.
