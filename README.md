# Classic Mini ECU Map
## Base Maps

Welcome to the public record of the Bad Wolf Turbo Maps! This repository was created to track all changes done to my base maps. **This repo includes multiple base maps.** All are public and can be used to help you get a spring board to start your mapping on your own car.

Before using you must understand these are **_NOT PLUG AND PLAY_**.

All maps will require you to bring your car and have it properly configured on a dyno to get the best and safest results. After reading the below disclaimer the download links are located in each section below.
